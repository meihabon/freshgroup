              <li>
                <b>Overview Metrics:</b> At the top, you‚Äôll see the total number of students and a summary of key attributes.  
                Use this to quickly assess the size and composition of your student population.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Demographic Breakdowns:</b> Charts display distributions by sex, program, municipality, income category, and SHS background.
